#### Why use version control?

If you have ever ...

- changed your code, then sometime later, wanted to revert back to your old code
- had to develop multiple versions of your code
- wanted to merge one feature into a different version of your code
- lost the code backup you needed
- wanted to test a new feature without messing with your working code
- been distracted by too much commented code that you kept just in case

If you have, then version control can help.

Yes, there is learning curve, but it will save you time in the long run if you code a lot.

#### Why use GitHub for version control?

Not only is GitHub multiplatform (Linux, Mac, Windows) and open source, but users clone (copy) the entire respository (project), so working offline is easy.  Plus, it appears that GitHub is currently the most popular version control platform (with commits to the cloud), so collaborating with others should be relatively easy with GitHub.
